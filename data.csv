Do I still love her?,Message,Date,Time
Yes,You moved out and I miss you a lot. This is going to be hella hard. Also cried missing you. Fuck I am crying writing this now. Such a baby fr,23-Apr-25,23:52:13
Yes,Saw your hair in the bathroom today while showering and started crying thinking about you. Also I didn’t wanna wait to say I love you especially since you are here. That's why I said it out of no where. It's gonna be so hard when I can't say it to you anymore.,24-Apr-25,17:05:55
Yes,It's crazy how much I miss you. I wanna be selfish yk. I wanna tell you I don’t wanna do no contact. I wanna do long distance. But those are my selfish wants and I dont wanna put these above your needs. Man this sucks. I love you.,25-Apr-25,13:30:13
Yes? I think so,"Man being away from you is hard. Don’t get me wrong I do love you. But I can't get this feeling out of my head that this is temporary. That after you leave, there won't be any reuniting ever again. Maybe it's cuz I've been talking to my friends about us doing no contact. And weirdly enough (or maybe not weirdly enough) everyone of em (7) are confused. they say ""when u know that's the one you would do the distance"" and i get that point and i get your point that you are hesitant. But then is it fair for me to come to you? There are so many doubts in my head rn that you are no with me. My female friends are saying they are like you but her current boyfriend is so good she'd do ldr with him. does that mean i am not good enough? Cause if we both know we are gonna meet again then is it not the matter of waiting it out? and there's internet for a reason right? Cuz one year, ik it's a long time but time flies by as long as we make sure there's time for each other. They told me that if we both are worried about other person cheating or meeting someone else, just vocalise those worries so it doesnt happen. But we already did that. idk man, I love you, I do. But do you love me? I feel like you do. I guess it's kinda my fault. I just accepted the fact that you dont wanna do long distance but never asked for your reasons so whenever someone asks me why we aint doing ldr, i find myself out of words. I'll try to ask you the reason on 3rd May, but I have a feeling that it wont end good. If I never see you after 3rd may, just know i truly loved you and I tried my best to not let it end.",27-Apr-25,15:25:27
