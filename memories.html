                <p>"You sneaky sneaky stalker,</p>
                <p>You found this link and page before you even got my 1-year letter huh? I guess you really do love me huh? Well, I love you too. And I am amazed you still remember my password because this is the wrong password HAHA. Don't worry, you know the real password, so if you are that curious to see what this actually is, go to the first page and try the real password.</p>
                <p>I don't know how long in the future you are seeing this page, but if the link is still there, that means I am missing you every day and I love you still.</p>
                <p>A little secret. Remember on 25th April 2025 (present day for me) I said I was gonna go to Sinchon to meet my friend? He left on the 24th lol. I was only going there cause I missed you and I wanted to see you, even if it was for 5 mins, but you were too busy. Oh well, hopefully this never happens again. Next time when I see you, hopefully we never have to part ways for long.</p>
                <p>I love you Garfield....I mean Dulu,</p>
                <p>Stay safe and healthy! ðŸ’˜</p>
                <p>PS: I'll add the journal page photos here when I write them (in case the images aren't there yet, in that case, damn, bro didn't wait even a month, call me, I miss you!)"</p>
